# **Intro and Recap**
Hello again! This week we are continuing our discussion of the material that will most likely appear in the AWS Certified Cloud Pracitioner (CCP) Exam. Last time we went over a part of the eighth module, Databases, and briefly discussed the services of RDS, Aurora, Redshift, and DynamoDB.  In this post, we'll talk about Cloud Architecture. Let's get started!

# **Cloud Architecture** 
In this module you go over some design principles and tools to help with building your architecture in the cloud. We'll talk about the Well-Architected Framework, the concepts of reliability and high availability, and finally AWS Trusted Advisor.

## **Well-Architected Framework** 
The Well-Architected Framework is a guide for designing infrastructure that is secure, high performing, resilient, and efficient. It was created as a way to provide best practices after reviewing thousands of customers' architectures. The framework is comprised of pillars, which each have a set of design principles and best practices. Currently, there are 6 pillars: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Sustainability. The mnemonic I came up with is Only Striped Racers Perform Consistent Speed.

## **Reliability and High Availability**
