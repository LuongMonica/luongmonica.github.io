# Intro to Cortex XSOAR
Cortex XSOAR... have you heard of it? If you're really into security you just might have! Cortex XSOAR is an extended security orchestration, automation, and response tool from Palo Alto Networks. It's used primarily by security operations teams to view incidents, manage tickets, and automate incident response workflows. However, there's other use cases too! Since it has the power of automation behind it, you can use it to automate any workflows you have. For example, use it for user lifecylce management; activate new hires on their hire date, provision the necessary apps for them, and disable and terminate their accounts on their end date. There's so many possibilities with XSOAR!
